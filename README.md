# Matrix Properties Checker

This repository contains a simple code implementation to check various properties of a matrix, including periodicity, involutivity, idempotency, and nilpotency. The code is written in JAVA, making it easy to understand and use.

## Features

The Matrix Properties Checker code provides the following features:

1. **Periodicity Check**: Determines if the matrix exhibits periodicity, i.e., whether the matrix raised to some power repeats itself.
2. **Involutivity Check**: Verifies if the matrix is involutory, meaning that multiplying the matrix by itself results in the identity matrix.
3. **Idempotency Check**: Checks if the matrix is idempotent, which implies that multiplying the matrix by itself yields the same matrix.
4. **Nilpotency Check**: Determines whether the matrix is nilpotent, i.e., the matrix raised to some power becomes the zero matrix.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please create an issue or contact one of the contributors directly. We appreciate your interest in this project!
